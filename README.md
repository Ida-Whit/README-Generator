## Usage
In order to use this generator, open a terminal from the index.js file. Type in "node index.js" and then be faced with a series of questions. Once you answer all of these questions, a README will be generated for you. Once you view the README you will see a badge showing your license at the top followed by a table of contents. You can click on each item in the table of contents and be taken to that section.
